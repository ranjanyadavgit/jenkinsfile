This Groovy script is designed for use in Jenkins pipelines and involves the use of various tools and stages to manage a continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) process. Here's a breakdown of its key components:

Pod Template Setup: A Kubernetes pod template is defined for running Maven builds inside a Docker container using the maven:3.3.9-jdk-8 image. The pod mounts a local directory to cache Maven dependencies.

Node and Container Setup: The Jenkins pipeline runs within the defined Kubernetes pod, using the mvn container for executing Maven commands.

Build Steps:

Branch Detection: The pipeline checks if the build is for a pull request, feature branch, or main/master branch.
CodeQL Initialization and Analysis: For certain branches, the pipeline initializes and runs CodeQL for static code analysis and uploads the results.
Build Execution: The pipeline performs the Maven build, running unit tests, and other stages based on the branch type.
Functions for Different Pipeline Stages:

installCodeQL(), initCodeQL(), analyzeAndUploadCodeQLResults(): Handle CodeQL setup and analysis.
isPRMergeBuild(), getPRNumber(), checkout(): Manage branch and pull request-specific operations.
build(), unitTest(), allTests(), preview(), preProduction(), manualPromotion(), production(): Define various stages of the CI/CD pipeline.
createRelease(), deployToStage(), herokuDeploy(), switchSnapshotBuildToRelease(), buildAndPublishToArtifactory(), promoteBuildInArtifactory(), distributeBuildToBinTray(): Handle deployment to Heroku and Artifactory, and release creation.
Utility Functions:

mvn(): Wrapper function for executing Maven commands with or without CodeQL.
shareM2(): Configures a shared Maven repository.
getRepoSlug(), getBranch(): Retrieve repository and branch information.
createDeployment(), setDeploymentStatus(), setBuildStatus(): Manage GitHub deployment statuses and notifications.
getCurrentHerokuReleaseVersion(), getCurrentHerokuReleaseDate(): Retrieve information about the current Heroku release version and date.
Key Considerations:
Credentials Management: The script uses credentials for GitHub and Heroku stored in Jenkins to authenticate API requests.
Error Handling: The pipeline includes stages to handle failures and notify the appropriate status to GitHub.
Modularity: Functions are well-defined and modular, making the script easier to maintain and extend.
Flexibility: The script can handle different branch types and adjust the pipeline stages accordingly.
